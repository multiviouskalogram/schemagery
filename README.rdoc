= Schemagery
Add following line to your `Gemfile`:


    gem 'schemagery', :groups => [:test, :development]


Next, add following line in your `routes.rb` file:

	mount Schemagery::Engine => "/schemagery"

This will generate a view at '/schemagery' so you can view your schema!

Errors may be thrown if you have some lingering uninitialized constants in your app.

This is very much in development, but with much anticipated future improvement!
